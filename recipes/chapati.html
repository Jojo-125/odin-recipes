    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Chapati is a beloved unleavened flatbread made from flour, water, oil, and salt.</p><p> It's a staple food, often enjoyed with stews, curries, or as a wrap. </p><p>The dough is layered with oil during rolling, creating a flaky and crunchy texture. </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Whole wheat flour</li>
            <li>Water</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Cooking oil</li>

        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Warm the water and stir the salt into it to dissolve.</li>
        <li>Make a well in the middle of the flour and pour the salted water.</li>
        <li>Knead the dough for about 5-10 minutes ensuring there are no flour pockets</li>
        <li>Once the dough comes to the desired texture(not hard and not too wet), cover it with cling fild and ret it settle for about 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Portion the dough into few balls, cover, and begin by rolling each one as thin as you can get it. Then drizzle 1 tablespoon of oil evenly across it, and a somewhat generous pinch of flour evenly across it before rolling and twirling it onto itself.</li>
        <li>Heat the cast iron pan at medium heat as you roll out the dough balls. Do not roll them too thin or they will be tough.</li>
        <li>Place the chapati on the pan without oil and let it cook until it changes color on the top then flip it over and as the bottom cooks you can now add oil to the top. Flip it over again and add some oil to the now top then flip it back (so each side has been cooked twice). Each chapati should cook for at least 3 minutes and not more otherwise it will dry out.</li>
        <li>Serve with stew like beans,lentils,greengrams and meat stew.</li>
    </ol>
