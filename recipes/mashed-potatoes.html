   <h2>Description</h2>
   <p>Mashed potatoes is a dish made by mashing boiled or steamed potatoes, usually with added milk, butter, salt, and pepper.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Potatoes</li>
            <li>Butter</li>
            <li>Milk or Cream</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <LI>Pepper</LI>
            </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Peel the potatoes, cut them into evenly sized pieces and wash them till they are clean.</li>
            <li>Place them in cold water into a stockpot. Make sure the water line sits about an inch above the potatoes.</li>
            <li>Turn on high heat until the water comes to a boil. Boil the potatoes for about 10-12 minutes until a knife inserted in the middle of a potato goes in with almost no resistance. Carefully drain out all of the water.</li>
            <li>As the potatoes are boiling, heat your butter, milk and an additional 2 teaspoons of salt together either in a small saucepan or in the microwave until the butter is just melted. </L>
            <li>Return the potatoes to the hot stockpot, and then place the stockpot back on the hot burner, turning the heat down to low.</li>
            <li>Using your preferred kind of masher, mash the potatoes to your desired consistency.</li>
            <li>Pour half of the melted butter mixture over the potatoes, and fold it in with a wooden spoon or spatula until potatoes have soaked up the liquid. Repeat with the remaining butter. And then again with the cream and pepper. Fold each addition in until just combined to avoid overmixing. </li>            
            <lI>Serve warm, garnished with any extra toppings that you might like, and enjoy</lI>
        </ol>
